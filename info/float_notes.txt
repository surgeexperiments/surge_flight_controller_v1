Floating point numbers can be single precision (�float� in C) or double precision (�double� in C).

The FPU in the Cortex-M4 processor supports single precision operations, but not double. If double 
precision calculation is present, the C compiler will use runtime library functions to handle the calculation 
in software. For best performance, it is best to handle the calculation in single precision if possible.  
Note that most compilers will emulate double precision using integer operations (not single precision FP).

Use float not double if you have FPU. double is not floating point, that's why FPU does not have any effect.
